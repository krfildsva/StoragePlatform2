# Decentralized Storage Sharing Platform
## Overview
This project is a decentralized storage sharing platform where users can rent out unused storage space on their devices. The platform enables file encryption, fragmentation, and distributed storage across multiple nodes. It includes both storage provider and storage consumer functionality, using smart contracts for automated transactions.

## Core Feature
File Encryption and Fragmentation: Files are encrypted and split into fragments, which are distributed across multiple nodes.

## Usage

In Terminal:
pip install cryptography
npm install hardhat axios bcrypt child-process cors express express-session mongoose multer nodemon path request uuid

In index.js specify your nodes IPs like: "http://node1:3000/store", "http://node2:3000/store".

Create upload/fragments folder for data hash.

You need multiple devices for every node!
